# Gator-Game-Grabber
- all source code is in index.js
- Video game recommendation system 
- Utilized the IGDB API and the axios library to collect and manage all of the data (video games and all their properties). 
- Implemented an undirected weighted Graph data structure of video game objects and calculated the edge weights based on their similar genres and themes. 
- Executed the Dijkstra and BFS Graph algorithms to find an array of the shortest weighted distances from the source game to all the other games. 
- Implemented the selection sort algorithm on that array of distances to sort them from least distance to greatest distance. 
- The top 20 from that array were then found as the most similar video games to the source game. 
- Our project's output is almost the same to the video game recommendations that the IGDB website displays for each video game.
